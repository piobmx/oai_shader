# GPT Shader

## Introduction

`GPT Shader` is an attempt to render AI generated code in real time in the browser. Straightforwardly, user can write a simple prompt and the app uses the OpenAI API to generate fragment shader code which would be rendered on a geometry shape if the code is runnable.

## Motivation

The idea emerged when I was learning GLSL with the help of ChatGPT.
I thought to myself why not just build a website with 3D libraries and render the result directly on the website.
After some digging on the internet I found only few projects with similar ideas, I then started to make my own version of it.
